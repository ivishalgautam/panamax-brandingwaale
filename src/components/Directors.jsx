            MONIKA SINGLA
          </h2>
          <p>
            Mrs. Monika Singla, a proud native of Delhi and an Arts Graduate
            from the University of Delhi, has played a vital role in the
            formation and growth of Panamax. Alongside her husband, she shares a
            common vision and has made significant contributions to establishing
            Panamax as the most trusted and preferred brand among our loyal
            patrons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their blessings extend to their children, Ms. Tanishka Singla and
            Mr. Nipun Singla, who form an integral part of the Singla family.
            But beyond blood ties, the Singlas consider their Panamax team as an
            extended familyâ€”a family that stands united, even in the face of
            adversity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most treasured Panamax memory for both founders revolves around
            a past Diwali when a small medical situation kept them away from
            home. The entire Panamax family, including their dedicated employees
            whom they regard as family, rallied together. They not only brought
            the Singla children to the workplace but also celebrated the entire
            Diwali with love and care. Acting as local guardians, the employees
            made sure the children felt cherished, sharing gifts and sweets with
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Panamax family remains eternally grateful to both founders for
            their unwavering support and dedication. Their efforts have
            contributed to the continual growth and strength of the Panamax
            family tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are inspired by the unity and vision of our founders and wish
            to be a part of our exceptional Panamax family, we urge you to
            connect with us immediately. Together, we can create a remarkable
            journey and shape a future filled with success and fulfilment.
