            Panamax a name synonym to trust and relation. Little did we know
            when we the Panamax Family questioned ourselves about what is that
            single factor that keeps us together, binds us with our customers
            and differentiate us vis-Ãƒ -vis our competitors.
          </p>

            Together we concluded that it is nothing else but our ability and
            our passion to live every single day of our life to win the trust of
            our customers and build a relation with every single of our
            stakeholder that leads us together to the path of success and
            prosperity.
